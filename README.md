# premier-league

This project was about exploiting data from provided constants/arrayTeams.php file.

The main goal was to create an index.php page displaying all English Premier League clubs information :
* Name
* Badge
* Description
* Year of foundation
* Home shirt
* Stadium name
* Stadium picture

The desired layout was 4 teams per row, each team in a card containing above information.
